# mass-ulw

Use this skill when the user asks for `mass-ulw`, a task DAG, staged fan-out, or any multi-agent job where real dependencies exist: task C needs A and B finished first. For fully independent workers, plain parallel `task` spawns are simpler. Reach for `dag` when the ordering itself is the point.

## Planning - MANDATORY first step

Before defining ANY graph, read `references/planning.md` (relative to this skill's own directory) IN FULL. Do not call `sdk.define`, `sdk.start`, or `tool.dag` with `action: "start"` before reading it. It carries the working doctrine this file deliberately omits: how to decompose the request into nodes, how to route each node's `category`, how to keep parallel write scopes disjoint, the node prompt contract, the verification wave, and the failure playbook. A graph defined without it is unplanned work.

## The shape

A run is a declarative definition: a stable `key` (idempotency: re-starting the same key with the same graph reuses the run), a human `name`, and `nodes`. Each node has an `id`, a self-contained English `prompt`, a `category` that routes it to the right kind of worker, and optional `dependsOn` listing node ids that must finish first. `dependsOn` is ordering ONLY: no upstream output is substituted into a downstream prompt, so write every prompt to stand alone. Optional per-node extras: `label`, `task_summary`, `description`, and `load_skills` (skill names prepended to that node's prompt).

Route every node by `category` using the routing table in `references/planning.md`; the run executes nodes in parallel waves as their dependencies clear.

## Running a dag - eval is the default

Build and run every dag INSIDE an eval cell. The eval kernel installs the `tool.dag` proxy and the extension publishes a small JS SDK at `OMO_DAG_SDK_ROOT`; driving runs from a cell is what unlocks the orchestration patterns in `references/planning.md` (data-driven graph construction, multi-run composition, concurrent runs, adaptive retries).

JS cells import the SDK from the path the extension publishes:

```js
const sdk = await import(`${env("OMO_DAG_SDK_ROOT")}/sdk.js`)

const dag = sdk.define({ key: "docs-refresh", name: "Docs refresh" })
dag.node({ id: "audit", category: "unspecified-low", prompt: "Audit docs/ for stale API references and list each stale file with the outdated claim." })
dag.node({ id: "rewrite", category: "writing", prompt: "Rewrite every stale page under docs/ against the current API surface in src/.", dependsOn: ["audit"] })
dag.node({ id: "verify", category: "quick", prompt: "Check every code sample under docs/ compiles and every internal link resolves.", dependsOn: ["rewrite"] })

const run = await sdk.start(dag)
const result = await sdk.wait(run.run_id)
```

`define` builds the definition and rejects duplicate node ids locally, before anything is started. `start`, `attach`, `snapshot`, `wait`, and `cancel` are the whole surface.

Python cells cannot import the ESM SDK; call `tool.dag({...})` directly with the same payload shape the SDK produces. Prefer a JS cell whenever the run involves any orchestration beyond a single `start` + `wait`.

## Run lifecycle

`start` returns a `run_id` and a snapshot; keep the id. From there:

```js
const sdk = await import(`${env("OMO_DAG_SDK_ROOT")}/sdk.js`)
const runId = "run_stub_1"
await sdk.attach(runId)
await sdk.snapshot(runId)
await sdk.cancel(runId, "superseded by a new plan")
```

- `attach` re-binds to a live run you already own, for example after your own context was rebuilt.
- `snapshot` is a cheap read of status and node counts; poll it instead of `wait` when you have other work to do.
- `wait` blocks until the run settles and returns the final result.
- `cancel` stops the run; pass a reason so the record says why.

## Resume across a restart

Runs are journaled. When the session dies mid-run, the run pauses instead of being lost; on restart the extension resumes paused runs it owns, reusing outputs of nodes that already finished so completed work is never redone. Your side of the contract: `start` with the same `key` and definition returns the existing run (`reused: true`) instead of forking a duplicate, or `attach` with the stored `run_id`. Never re-issue a changed definition under an old key; that's a definition conflict.

## Observing a run

- The TUI status widget shows live runs with per-node progress.
- `/dag` opens the detail view: node states, waves, and failures for each run in the session.
- External viewers subscribe to the RPC channels `omo.dag.event` (journaled, sequenced), `omo.dag.updated` (full snapshots), `omo.dag.heartbeat`, and `omo.dag.activity`.
